		            <h4 class="chapter__title Playfair_bold">Prologue</h4>
		                <p class="article_p">I was in the water. That’s one part I’ll always remember. It was the morning of June 13, 1999. I was 16 and cooling off during my break as a lifeguard at a neighborhood pool down the street from my parents’ house in Reston, Va. I can still recall that familiar rush of freedom, the heedless plunge into ice-cold water on a not-yet-hot day, that I would feel at the start of every summer.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Until, out of nowhere, my friend Phillip roared his black Dodge Neon to the front of the pool gate, then jumped out, screaming at me alone.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“Jay Randall is dead!”</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Phillip, who was stocky, usually soft-spoken and would grow up to become a chef, raced toward me, his face etched with dread.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“Jay’s dead!” he cried again.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">I pulled myself from the pool, dripping wet. The wires in my brain struggled to make sense of the news. I grabbed my car keys and backpack and made the quick drive home, slogging into my parents’ house with a damp towel wrapped around my face, muffling the sobs.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">My mother instantly feared someone had drowned on my watch.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">No, I stammered.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">But something just as awful.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">My childhood best friend was dead.</p>

		        <div class="chapter" id="chapter-1_ctn">
		            <h4 class="chapter__title Playfair_bold">1. An unquestioned narrative</h4>
		                <p class="article_p">If I’m going to tell you the story of Jay, I need to start with the official record — the story that, at least until a few months ago, we all unquestioningly accepted.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">He was born on June 29, 1982 at Howard University Hospital in Washington, D.C., the youngest child to James and Peggy Randall, a lawyer and a health care representative, respectively. He had one sister, Christin, four years his elder. He was technically named James, after his father — though from the time he was a baby, everyone called him Jay.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">He lived in a new home off Steeplechase Drive, in one of the wealthier areas in Reston, a suburban enclave known for its diversity, quality schools and dense forests. His parents had been longtime residents of D.C., until just before Jay was born, when they relocated to the suburbs seeking more space for their growing family. Six years after that, my own family moved to a house on Citation Court, exactly one mile from Jay.</p>
		
		
		                <div class="image__ctn ">
		                    <img class="img" src="assets/images/jay/jay76.jpg" alt="jay76.jpg" />
		                    <div class="img__caption">jay76.jpg</div>
		                </div>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Within a year, we were inseparable, and thought nothing of it, a Black kid and a white kid stomping through the creeks looking for crayfish, exploring miles of meandering paths on our bikes and spending our summers on the neighborhood Hunters Woods Blue Marlins swim team. He was inordinately confident, brash, wickedly funny — when he ran for sixth grade class president, he won in a landslide.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Except at some point things came unstrung for Jay. He started hanging out with teenagers and twentysomethings who lived in the blighted, subsidized housing complexes in Reston. He began selling and using drugs and carrying a gun.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">His life ended on June 13, 1999, about 10 years after we first met, when Jay was just 16 years old. Police said Jay and his group of friends were involved in a fight at a high school graduation pool party. They left and returned later with guns, seeking retribution against the people with whom they had clashed. As Jay’s group made their way back into the party, an uproar ensued, and guns were fired — Jay’s first, according to news reports. A 40-year-old man named Eddie Bennett who was hosting the celebration for his daughter pulled a handgun and shot Jay and another man in self-defense, police determined.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">I grieved his death for weeks, dissolving into tears at the thought of him being gone. I couldn’t comprehend how this person I knew and cared for deeply became this other person being described in the media as violent, heedless and a threat to decent people.</p>
		
		
		                <div class="image__ctn right">
		                    <img class="img" src="assets/images/jay/jay78.jpg" alt="jay78.jpg" />
		                    <div class="img__caption">jay78.jpg</div>
		                </div>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Yet everyone who knew Jay seemed to accept what the investigators and the newspapers said happened. Bennett’s attorney was quoted in several articles touting his client as a hero who saved the day by firing back at the group of party-crashers — he had prevented “another Columbine,” the lawyer said. The case was closed less than six months later, and Bennett was never charged. Jay’s story became another cautionary tale of a young Black kid gone astray. His friends, the community and the world moved on, nothing to see here, as if it all had been a vivid dream.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">I didn’t move on. Yes, I grew up, went to college, pursued a career as a journalist, married and started a family — luxuries lost to Jay. But I never stopped thinking about my first best friend; never stopped wondering how things had unraveled so tragically for him. I never stopped imagining that maybe the truth was otherwise, that perhaps there had been another explanation for why he died.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Still, it took me nearly two decades, after telling his story to my wife and friends and colleagues, and listening to their prodding that I should revisit the case, that I finally felt ready to bring myself to do it. I guess on some level I was afraid of what the truth would be, that once I started digging, I’d find something that ruined my memory of Jay. Even after I finally starting reporting this story, there were multiple instances where I wondered if the effort was futile, or if I had any business digging into my friend’s history. Maybe I, too, finally needed to move on.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Here are some of the details the official narrative left out, which I uncovered after a nine-month investigation that included interviews with more than two dozen of Jay’s friends, family members and associates, legal experts, and public officials, as well as a careful review of heavily redacted police and forensic documents.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Jay was shot at point-blank range; the gun that killed him was fired as close as 12 inches from his body, not from several feet away as I had long assumed.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Bennett did not have a concealed weapon permit for his gun, despite the belief of many people I talked to — including Jay’s mother — that he did.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Investigators flagged Bennett’s statements for discrepancies, yet never appeared to follow up on them.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">And one other detail, buried deep in a forensic analysis report typed in neat blank ink, and then never referenced again:</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">My childhood best friend — who had been killed in a purported act of self-defense — had in fact been shot in the back.</p>
		
		
		        </div>
		
		        <div class="chapter" id="chapter-2_ctn">
		            <h4 class="chapter__title Playfair_bold">2.  The boy at center stage</h4>
		                <p class="article_p">It was the first day of school, the September air heavy with uncertainty. Jay Randall walked into Hunters Woods Elementary School, a backpack slung over his wiry shoulders. He rounded a corner and that’s when I saw him, standing outside Mrs. Bullis’ second-grade classroom — our purgatory for the next nine months.</p>
		
		
		                <div class="image__ctn ">
		                    <img class="img" src="assets/images/jay/jay24.jpg" alt="jay24.jpg" />
		                    <div class="img__caption">jay24.jpg</div>
		                </div>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Jay. We had met over the summer at the neighborhood pool; he was a taller-than-average kid, with light brown skin, handsome, even features and a box of curly black hair teetering atop his large, oval-shaped head. My eight-year-old self always thought he resembled a version of Christopher Reid from the hip-hop duo “Kid ‘n Play.”</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Now he saw me walking towards him, and he greeted me with that familiar, beaming smile — his whole face lifting and coming alive, his cheekbones popping out like tennis balls.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">And just like that, once Jay and I realized we were in the same class, those first-day-of-school anxieties melted away.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">How do you explain what makes two grade-school boys become best friends, other than a mysterious combination of personality, temperament and ridiculous good fortune? For Jay and me, we just clicked. We were similar, easygoing kids, who liked sports; had both mom and dad at home; and toed a line of being mostly well behaved, but with enough mischievousness to keep life interesting.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">During that first school year together, our class was asked to keep journals. I found mine earlier this year digging through cluttered boxes in my parents’ basement, almost perfectly intact. In December 1989, I wrote about Jay and I going to a birthday party at Chuck E. Cheese and being deemed too big for the ball pit — presumably because we were taller than most kids.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">The following month, I wrote about Jay coming to my house after school to play, summing it up succinctly: “We’re going to have fun. Jay is nice.”</p>
		
		
		                <div class="imgGroup1">
		                    <div class="imgGroup__ctn_1">
		                        <img class="imgGroup__img" src="assets/images/jay/Jay journal.jpg" alt="" />
		                        <img class="imgGroup__img" src="assets/images/jay/Second grade art.jpg" alt="" />

		                    </div>
		                </div>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">At the end of the school year, we were given sheets of paper with the header: “End of the year thoughts and opinions.” Underneath mine, I drew a picture of Jay and me, standing side-by-side: Jay with his high-top fade like a pencil eraser, and me with half-drawn arms. No caption necessary.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">And so it went, two silly boys, ages eight and then nine and then ten. In a group picture from my third-grade birthday party, he dived on top of me and mugged for the camera, the biggest personality in a group of 10 boys. In fourth grade, I played trumpet in our school’s band, and Jay liked to carry the instrument into the street outside my house and toot obnoxiously while imploring neighbors to toss change in the open case.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">I still smile thinking about a fourth-grade class trip to Old Town Alexandria, a historic district of cobblestone streets and 18th-century townhouses along the Potomac River. Jay and I straggled at the back of the pack, playing a game to see who could leap highest and touch light poles and door frames. Suddenly, Jay jumped into the air and slapped a loose brick that came tumbling on his head. Blood trickled down his face, but instead of screaming, he cackled uncontrollably. I was horrified by the sight of his wound — but it didn’t matter. I lost it, too, laughing hysterically in lockstep. Our chaperones and teacher were not similarly amused.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Jay often had that effect on me. His eyes could fill with such joy and goofiness that one well-timed glance could send me spiraling into a giggling fit. Scores of others in our school similarly were drawn to Jay. He even struck a friendship with our fourth-grade teacher, Rebecca Nellum Williams, who tutored him in reading and writing after Jay moved on to fifth grade. She knew Jay loved baseball, so she took the two of us to a Baltimore Orioles game in July of 1993.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“He was just a sweetheart,” Mrs. Williams told me earlier this year. “And his smile. I will never forget his smile.”</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">There was the obvious difference of our race, but our school was filled with kids of all difference ethnicities. Certainly, there were other Black-white friendships in Reston; and, honestly, I can’t recall any instances where we talked about the issue, other than to take pleasure in each other’s differences. I always was envious of his thick, curly hair, and I would beg him to let me slather it with Afro Sheen. I loved using his hair pick, the one with the handle forming a clenched fist, to brush out the rough patches.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">We were set to graduate from sixth grade in June of 1994, headed for middle school. One day at the kitchen table, before school ended, my mom gently tried to warn me that my relationship with Jay could change. We would be going to a far bigger school of about 1,200 students, with new kids from different parts of Reston. Jay may want to hang out with more Black kids, and I might make new friends, she told me.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“Jay and I will be best friends forever,” my mom recalled me saying. “Don’t even say such a thing.”</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">But Jay must have been having the same concerns. Because I remember an afternoon late that spring, when the two of us tagged along with his mom to the local high school while she worked the concession stand at Jay’s sister’s track meet. We killed time climbing the bleachers and scaling a metal gate on the far side of the stadium.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">And then, seemingly out of nowhere, Jay looked at me and said:</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“You’re going to leave me behind when we get to middle school. You’re going to forget about me.”</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">I scoffed.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“No way,” I told him.</p>

		                <p class="article_p">Peggy Randall, Jay’s mother, is a woman of slight build and height, with a whisper soft voice and a distinct motherly sweetness. When I called her in June, for the first in a series of conversations we had this year, she told me a story about Jay that I’d never heard before — even though I would have been there at the time.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">It happened, she said, during an elementary school birthday party, parents and kids all jostling around boxes of pizza and a sheet of sugary cake. For the first stretch of the bash, there were about 10 or so kids there — and Jay was the only one who wasn’t  white.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Until, an hour or so later, another group of kids were walking past, all of them Black.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“Here come the Black kids,” Jay told Peggy he overheard one of the white kids saying, snideness in his voice, oblivious that Jay was standing nearby.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“It’s like Jay didn’t count as a Black kid to them,” Peggy Randall said to me.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">To understand the story of Jay, you need to understand where we both grew up — a town that for most of the last century was nothing but undeveloped farmland. Until, that is, 1961, when Robert E. Simon, a young real estate entrepreneur, used proceeds from his family’s sale of Carnegie Hall to construct a pioneering planned community that insisted on walkability, density, access to nature and diversity of races and income levels. Simon named it “Reston” — derived from his “R.E.S.” initials.</p>
		
		
		                <div class="image__ctn ">
		                    <img class="img" src="assets/images/jay/jay77.jpg" alt="jay77.jpg" />
		                    <div class="img__caption">jay77.jpg</div>
		                </div>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">It’s called the “modern planned community” — The Woodlands outside of Houston is also one; Celebration, Florida, developed by the Walt Disney Company, is another. Reston is widely recognized as the first of them, and the idealism was poured right into the foundation. Simon wanted to create a place that would be the first of its kind, a “post-race” community that solved income disparity, poverty and generational racism.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">If you told my 10-year-old self all of this, I probably would have nodded and said, “Makes sense.” My best friend was Black. We spent our days swimming and fishing in four man-made lakes and tramping through 250 bountiful acres of woodlands. Our classrooms were a canvas of white and Black faces, along with kids from Pakistan and South Korea and Bolivia — the offspring of government workers in nearby Washington, D.C., or immigrants who lived in low-income housing.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">The reality, of course, was much more complicated — idylls usually are. In the early 1970s, community leaders in Reston actively sought to build subsidized housing for low-income families, a move that exemplified the utopian hope that rich and poor can and should coexist in the same community. The largest of these developments was Stonegate Village, a three-story, 240-unit complex built in 1972 — approximately one mile from my family’s house, and two miles from Jay’s — that would become home to a largely minority population of 1,500 people.</p>
		
		
		                <div class="image__ctn ">
		                    <img class="img" src="assets/images/jay/jay37.jpg" alt="jay37.jpg" />
		                    <div class="img__caption">jay37.jpg</div>
		                </div>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Within just a few years, though, community leaders were lodging complaints that these developments brought with them “unexpected social and economic problems and they want no more,” according to a 1978 Washington Post article. Residents argued the numerous low-income complexes in Reston were marred by unresponsive management and a lack of social programs. And by the late 1980s, Stonegate had become one of the Fairfax County’s main open-air drug markets, according to the Post, with little kids, some of whom were undoubtedly my classmates, serving as lookouts for dealers.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">In 1988, the year Jay and I entered first grade, about 150 people were arrested in or around Stonegate in a four-month span, mostly for selling drugs and carrying guns, according to the Post. Police also linked two killings that year to the drug trade at Stonegate.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">For me, Stonegate was just another part of town, whose residents I knew well from school or played basketball with; whatever crime or wrongdoing might have been happening there, it never penetrated my elementary-school consciousness.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">For Jay? That’s impossible to know, though as I reported this story, I kept coming back to the stark divisions contained within census data from Reston, available on city-data.com: The census quadrant that includes Stonegate is 73% Black, Hispanic or Asian, with 11% of its residents living below the poverty line and the median home valued at $95,000.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">The quadrant Jay lived in is 87% white, 3% Black and the median home value is $721,000.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Jay’s sister, Christin Randall Dougherty, told me she grappled throughout childhood with a kind of identity crisis — the Randalls were one of only handful of Black families they knew who didn’t live in Stonegate or other low-income housing throughout Reston. Both Christin and Jay were light-skinned, so people constantly thought they were mixed-race. And it seemed like their skin color, dialect or where they lived were constantly being pointed out.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“Not by other whites — by Blacks,” Christin told me. “And it was confusing. ‘Am I not appreciating my ethnic, racial identity because most of my friends are white?’ I think he really felt that intensely. He just was so young that he was still in the thick of it of trying to figure out who he was. You just don’t know would he have come to terms with, ‘I’m Black and I’m not from the hood and it’s okay.”</p>
		
		
		                <div class="image__ctn ">
		                    <img class="img" src="assets/images/jay/Sixth grade photo.jpg" alt="Sixth grade photo.jpg" />
		                    <div class="img__caption">Sixth grade photo.jpg</div>
		                </div>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Looking back, the first hint that Jay was struggling with his identity must have been near the end of sixth grade. My father drove us to the annual Reston Baseball Carnival, where Jay spotted another Black boy who he had scuffled with on the playground at school. For reasons none of us understood, Jay and the boy decided to fight that night, and a huge crowd gathered to egg them on — this despite the fact that the Jay I knew never started or wanted anything to do with fights.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">He lost that brawl, getting tagged repeatedly in the face, as I stood nearby, judging whether to help. It made no sense at the time, but later I realized Jay fought to try to prove himself, to try to shed the label of a soft kid from a nice part of town. He called me later that night, surveying the damage in his bathroom mirror.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“I got beat up,” he told me, forlornly, but with a hint of pride in his voice.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">We drifted apart. I swore I wouldn’t let that happen, but of course it did. Six or so months after that fight, in seventh grade, the first year of middle school, I made the Reston travel basketball team and practiced nearly year-round, then started spending almost every free moment with teammates or the boys in my neighborhood. Jay joined the Reston youth football team, where his mom said he started hanging out with more Black kids from the lower-income parts of town, including Stonegate.</p>

		                </div>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“He didn’t even want [his other Black friends] to know he was also on the swim team,” Peggy Randall said. “It was like his whole mindset and attitude changed.”</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“You guys were best friends and you went to the pool together all the time and went over to each other’s houses,” Christin told me. “And then in middle school it was just as if you and others he had gone to elementary school with didn’t exist.”</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">We still occasionally hung out. We obviously still liked each other when we did. But neither of us could seem to halt what came to seem inevitable; and once the experimentation of early adolescence commenced — rolling low-grade weed in Phillies blunts and swigging convenience store booze in the woods we once explored on our bikes — our friendship was very much in the past tense. Jay had his crew. I had mine.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">As it turned out, there was likely another reason I started seeing less of Jay — though it was one that I never would have imagined at the time.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Jay started selling crack.</p>

		            <h4 class="chapter__title Playfair_bold">4. The birth of Baby Jay</h4>
		                <p class="article_p">I had always known Jay became a drug dealer — it been rumored throughout high school, and it had been widely documented in the newspaper reports following his death.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">I just didn’t realize he had become one of the biggest drug dealers in Reston.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Pat McClafferty, who served time in juvenile detention with Jay and now works in auto sales in suburban Virginia, told me Jay started selling crack around age 14, after they stumbled upon a huge stash hidden in a thicket of bushes near Stonegate. They took the crack and divided it with two other friends to sell, McClafferty said.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“Jay really got on the grind hard with his portion and he became what we knew of Jay before he left us,” McClafferty said.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Why would Jay choose to do this, having heard the same drumbeat that I did in middle school about the danger and deadliness of the drug, and when he certainly didn’t need the money?</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">McClafferty didn’t have an answer to that one. “All that innocent stuff went out the door,” he said.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Person after person told me the same thing: In seemingly no time, my friend became one of the biggest drug dealers in Reston, a kid known on the streets as “Baby Jay” for his boyish appearance and extraordinarily young age in the trade.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Sam Jackson, another close friend of Jay’s, told me he moved away from Reston when Jay was 13, but returned a year later to find Jay had become a kingpin of sorts. Jackson told me he visited Jay’s house and it recalled a scene out of a movie, with Jay loaded with thick wads of cash and bags of drugs unlike anything he had ever seen.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“He was probably 14, and he had at least $5,000 on him,” Jackson said. “A super knot (of rolled up money) and a whole bunch of drugs. He was the man. Like, he was the dude with the drugs.”</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Yet despite my best efforts, and for as many people as I talked to about Jay, no one could quite explain the meteoric nature of his rise to kingpin status. Some told me Jay kept his moves close, and also that connections wasn’t something you discussed openly.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">People told me Jay made his initial entreaties into selling drugs in Stonegate; he was drawn to the complex’s gritty, hardened landscape, and he looked up to the dealers there. In time, and under their tutelage, he came to surpass many of them in earnings, several friends said.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“That boy had thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars,” said Ebony Sheppard, a woman nearly five years older than Jay who told me she sold drugs with him and later let Jay live with her. “When Jay came out of his shell, Jay was gangster.”</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Sheppard said Jay’s success stemmed from selling not only to addicts in the housing projects, but also wealthy clients he knew from his strait-laced days. He also was able to save money, she said, by not needing to spend it on shoes, clothes and food, which he still got from home. That money he saved, Shephard said, in turn went to buy larger quantities of drugs that he could re-sell.</p>
		
		
		                <div class="image__ctn ">

		                    <div class="img__caption">jay39.jpg</div>
		                </div>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">He became so successful, Jackson told me, that at least once a notorious fellow dealer from Stonegate, pleaded with the then 15-year-old Jay for drugs to sell.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“(The other dealer) was an O.G. to us, and he was begging Jay to buy shit off him,” Jackson said. “That blew my mind.”</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">As Jay climbed deeper into the trade, his distaste for school and authority amplified. Jay’s father, James Randall, died in 2014, but before he passed away, he wrote a paper titled, “Why Did Jay Die?” The two-page piece, written like a clinical research study, explored what pushed Jay to the streets. James Randall surmised that a learning disability made it difficult for Jay to succeed in school, prompting teachers to funnel him into classes with other “non-academic types … usually from the lower socio-economic rungs.”</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">James Randall wrote that in middle school he “found solace and common bond on these issues with boys from the projects or hood.”</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">From there, “it was an easy step to the outlaw world,” James Randall wrote. “He liked the fast life. He apprenticed well with older outlaws. Within a few years, he seemed to have attained financial renumeration beyond the wildest dreams of a young teenager, and even a certain degree of celebrity among the youth in the Reston area.”</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">James’ conclusion reads at once like the clear-eyed assessment of a clinician and the howl of despair of a father who watched his son slip away.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“How could values relating to hard work, nose to the grindstone perseverance, and hopeful, gradually advancement possibly compete with the concrete and immediate rewards he was reaping from outlaw culture,” he wrote.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">We entered South Lakes High School as freshmen in 1996, but that fall was the final time we ever were in school together. One day during the winter, Jay got into an altercation in the freshman sub-school with one of our classmates, a kind-spirited boy not known for trouble. After Jay and the other boy, who also was Black, stared each other down for what felt like hours, they brawled between the lockers.</p>

		                <p class="article_p">It wasn’t the first time Jay had been in trouble at South Lakes, but it was the final straw. He was expelled.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">He bounced between alternative schools, misbehaving or skipping them altogether. It was around this time, in 1995, that Jay was arrested for the first time and taken to the Fairfax County Juvenile Detention Center, his mom said. Peggy Randall couldn’t recall the specific reason for the first arrest, or others that followed. But, according to police reports I obtained, he was arrested roughly a half-dozen times, for possession of drugs with intent to distribute, possession of marijuana, destruction of property, larceny, burglary and probation violation. It’s not known if he was ever charged for any of these offenses; juvenile records are sealed in Virginia.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Sometime in 1998, when Jay would have been a sophomore in high school, he missed a court-imposed curfew and faced 30 days in the lockup, triggering him to vanish on and off for about a year.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“Sometimes I’d be constantly anxious,” Peggy Randall said. “And then I’d imagine him coming to the door, coming home. But that didn’t happen. He stayed out there.”</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Christin Dougherty Randall, then in college, constantly feared for her younger brother. On a visit home, she realized Jay had been gone for weeks, so she jumped in her car and drove around Reston until she found him and brought him home.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“He obviously didn’t stay,” Christin said. “I think he thought this life was exciting, and it killed him.”</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">It’s not clear what Jay was doing or where he was living during the time he was away. But it appears he was continuing to sell drugs, living with various older women and crashing with friends, his mom and friends told me. From time to time, he would call his mom at work, just to let her know he was “alive and well enough,” she said.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Each time Jay appeared in the Fairfax County Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court, the judge never seemed to know what to do with him, Peggy Randall said.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“The judge would just give of him a stern talking to and say, ‘Go home and behave yourself. You’ve got a good family,’” she recalled. “It just didn’t seem to work with him because once he knew how to get money, he was gone.”</p>

		                <p class="article_p">Sometime over the year or so before his death, Jay also began having problems with other dealers, according to his parents. During the brief spates of time he was home, he seemed paranoid, Peggy Randall said, warning her not to let anybody in the house she didn’t know, and asking if anyone had been coming around looking for him.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">It was perhaps around the same time — a year or so before he died — that three of Jay’s friends told me he was attacked by an older rival. Some people told me the rival robbed Jay of money or drugs, but they weren’t certain. Sheppard described the rival as an older man jealous of Jay’s drug trade success; she said the man slapped Jay in front of a group of people at the August 1998 Georgia Avenue Day celebration in Washington, D.C. (The man, now imprisoned in West Virginia, did not respond to a letter I sent seeking an interview.) The altercation left Jay bitterly embarrassed, Sheppard said, and further emboldened his desire to protect himself.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">It wasn’t until this point, around November 1998, that Jay took the next leap in the street life, friends told me: He got a gun — a silver AMT 9mm Luger. He needed it for protection, his friends said. It was one of the same guns found at the scene of his death.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">His parents, though, never lost hope for their only son. Jay was released from juvenile detention for the final time in the first half of 1999, Peggy Randall said. He moved home and seemed to listen when they’d ask him to turn down his music or tell them where he was going. He also had gotten his high school equivalency degree while in jail, and his sister helped him take classes to land a job as a lifeguard.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">I remember seeing his name on the master lifeguard roster that June, totally shocked but also quietly thrilled. We had drifted apart, and I had almost no idea at the time how desperate things had gotten for Jay, but maybe now we’d be coming together again. I imagined hanging out, bringing him along to lifeguard parties, riding around together in my boxy Volvo, a more grown-up version of our old best buddy routine.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">He was shot to death about a week later.</p>

		                <p class="article_p">On Saturday, June 12, 1999, Bennett, then age 40, and his wife hosted a party for their daughter, Shauntai, who was graduating from Park View High, a public school in Sterling. They picked the Four Seasons Pool and Clubhouse, a drab-colored, two-story facility in nearby Herndon whose second floor entertainment area can be rented for private parties. The Bennetts had it from 8 p.m. to 1 a.m., making plans for a DJ and music, and circulating fliers touting the bash. Guests were asked to pay $2 to defray costs.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">The questions of how and why Jay ended up at that party — and had his subsequent fatal encounter with Bennett — are ones no one could entirely answer for me.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Jay spent the early part of June 12, 1999 at a friend’s house in Reston named Chandra Owen, smoking weed and jumping on her family’s trampoline with other friends, according to Owen. She said Jay originally was planning to go to the Herndon Festival — an annual celebration with rides, live music and carnival games. But after leaving Owen’s house around dusk, he stopped in a low-income Reston neighborhood known as Cedar Ridge, then headed to Herndon with a group of three or four older men he didn’t normally spend much time with, friends told me.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">It’s not clear if Jay’s group went to the festival, but they did end up at the party around 9 p.m., according to police reports. Both Peggy Randall and Owen said Jay knew Shauntai Bennett, and they believed he was an invited guest.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">The first skirmish happened almost immediately. One of the men with Jay spotted a rival, according to Byron Stafford, a witness at the party. There was bad blood between the two groups, according to police documents, involving a member of one faction testifying against a member of the other faction in a federal drug case. The rival’s brother or relative, who was at the party, also was the same man who slapped Jay the previous year at the parade, friends told me.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">The two groups headed outside to fight near a dumpster. As they made their way out, several unknown males swooped in and attacked one or more of the people with Jay, according to police documents.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Eddie Bennett called police, who arrived in squad cars and broke up the crowd. The party got back to normal and the celebration continued.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">That should have been the end of it.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">But a witness told police they saw Bennett hop in his vehicle, drive away from the clubhouse and return about 20 minutes later. Where Bennett went and what he did during that time were questions later raised by police.</p>
		
		
		                <div class="image__ctn ">

		                    <div class="img__caption">jay13.jpg</div>
		                </div>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Jay’s group also left. One of the men in his group, Toby Dews, seethed with anger, barking about returning to the party and getting even, witnesses told me. They travelled to the house of a man named Moe Trammel in Herndon. There, according to Trammel, Dews continued to stew over the earlier beating, building up resentment.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">At some point, Ebony Sheppard said Jay or the people with him called her about unlocking her Reston home so Jay could get his gun, which he had been storing at her place. Sheppard said she resoundingly told them no, but that another person living at the home must have opened the door.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">A little after 11 p.m., a group of about seven people — including Jay, Dews and Trammel — hopped in two cars and headed back to the party, this time armed with weapons, Trammel said. Jay was carrying his silver 9mm handgun, Trammel told me. The teenagers and twentysomethings had been drinking and smoking, and two friends told me Jay and others with him may have even been smoking weed laced with PCP, a mind-altering drug that can cause hallucinations.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">The intention never was to shoot or kill anybody, but “more just to try to scare somebody,” Trammel said. None of Jay’s friends know his true motivation for returning to the party armed. Sheppard and others believe something happened to Jay at the party — perhaps an altercation or personal threat — that angered him to the point of arming himself. Other friends presume it may have been another example of Jay, believed to be the youngest of the group and still impressionable, trying to prove himself to the older men.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Jay and the others arrived back to the clubhouse around 11:30 p.m.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Jay’s group strode toward the front entrance, a small foyer with stairs leading up to the second floor. Partygoers, sensing trouble, began rushing toward the door, presumably to block them from entering, witnesses said.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Jay, carrying a gun wrapped in a red bandana, according to two witnesses and police, immediately pushed his way into the foyer and staircase area, where a crush of the party’s participants were crammed and jostling.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Then, the gunshots rang out.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">And that’s the point at which various accounts differ. Bennett told police Jay raised his gun and pointed it at someone’s head, although the police reports redacted whoever this might have been. Byron Stafford, a friend of Jay’s at the party, also said he saw Jay lift his gun before he was tackled from behind by an unknown man.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Peggy Randall said she was told by police that Jay was tussling with a nephew of Bennett’s.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Trammel said Bennett, who was dressed in some sort of security outfit, fired his gun first.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“He just started shooting,” Trammel told me. “That guy didn’t ask no questions.”</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">(Eddie Bennett did not answer his door or respond to the letter I left for him there in June, or to later phone messages.)</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">At some point, Jay fired his gun straight above his head and into the ceiling. Trammel said he thought Jay shot into the roof to disperse the crowd. Jay never shot in anyone’s direction, Trammel added.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Police determined Jay fired only that one time.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Bennett fired five times, hitting Jay once in the back.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">After this initial volley of shots, Jay sprinted from the clubhouse, a massive hole blasted through in his abdomen, spurting blood on the walls and floor, according to witnesses and police.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Bennett also headed out of the clubhouse, according to the police reports. He was attempting to close the front door, he told police, when he saw Robert Clay, a man he thought had been with Jay’s group, outside the clubhouse, “holding his arm behind his leg.” Bennett believed Clay was armed and reaching for a weapon, he told police.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Bennett fired again. The shot ripped into Clay’s stomach, and he fell to the ground.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Bennett gave his gun to someone in the party, telling them to hide it under the DJ’s turntable, according to the police reports.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Police never determined if Clay had a gun.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Meanwhile, Jay was staggering into the parking lot. Two friends, Stafford and T.J. Fobbs, were peeling away in Fobbs’s mother’s white Hyundai Elantra when Jay waved them down, the men told me. Fobbs screeched to a halt and Jay collapsed into the outside of the passenger’s side front door. Fobbs leaned over to open it, and Jay fell into the car.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Fobbs roared toward Reston Hospital Center, his left hand gripping the steering wheel and his right applying pressure to Jay’s wound. Stafford sat in the backseat, screaming for Fobbs to run red lights. Jay groaned and his eyes rolled back in his head.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">They made the 3.6-mile drive to the hospital in less than 10 minutes, screeching to the front of the emergency room entrance. Stafford and Fobbs leapt out, lifted Jay from the front seat and carried him inside.</p>

		                </div>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">The wound was too severe to be treated at Reston Hospital. Instead, Jay was flown via helicopter to the trauma center at Inova Fairfax Hospital.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">He survived emergency surgery.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">But he died that morning at 7:38 a.m.</p>

		            <h4 class="chapter__title Playfair_bold">6. The search for answers</h4>
		                <p class="article_p">The modest townhome with white clapboard siding and pale blue shutters is almost hidden on a narrow, car-lined street in Bowie, Md., a sprawling city about 15 miles northwest of Washington, D.C. I had been trying to contact Robert Clay for months about the night 21 years ago when he and Jay were shot by Eddie Bennett. But he never responded to any of my texts, phone calls or emails.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">I pulled in front of his house on a sunny day in June, in the middle of a global pandemic. I took a deep breath, then headed down a small concrete walkway and knocked on the door. A squat man with thinning hair and a thick beard, wearing gray athletic shorts and a gray tank top, opened the door.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Robert Clay, the man shot that night but who survived.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">He knew who I was. He had seen or heard some of my messages. But he politely refused, repeatedly, my pleading for a formal, on-the-record interview. And he kept asking me the same question, over and over.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“Why do you care?”</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">I told him that I wanted to tell the real story of what happened to my friend. I told him that nothing about the official story of the shooting made sense to me.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">We chatted there on his porch for nearly an hour, discussing everything that happened that night and how it impacted his life. But no matter how hard I tried, I could not convince him to be a part of the story.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Eventually, Clay sent me on my way, back to Reston, to knock on more doors.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">I never imagined I would have trouble finding people willing to talk about Jay. After all, I’m from Reston, born and raised — I grew up in the same place as many of the people in this story. I assumed that some of them, at the very least, would want for Jay to be afforded the basic dignity of a fair and honest accounting of his death.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">But a day after leaving Clay’s house, I tried to find Toby Dews, the man who several of Jay’s friends told me should know better than anyone what happened the night Jay was shot. No one answered at an address I found for him, and he never responded to a letter I left at his door or several phone messages and emails.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Other friends of Jay’s I tried to reach who I thought could shed light on the matter — including three people rumored to be with him the night of the death — either didn’t respond to my messages or refused to make themselves available for interviews. It was frustrating and more than a little bit heartbreaking to realize the people with Jay the night he died seemingly cared so little about him that they couldn’t be bothered to speak to me.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">I did manage to reach by telephone Chris Watson, a Reston native from Stonegate who had taken Jay under his wing. (He told me he was in jail when Jay was killed.) Yet when I asked for help finding people who had been with Jay the night of his death, he told me I was wasting my time.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“As far as all the names that you have, I doubt anyone is going to talk to you,” Watson said. “To really be honest with you. This shit right here is not something that people want to go back on.”</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">During an abrupt conversation, Watson said that Jay had been drawn to the flashy life selling drugs in Stonegate; that he was young and impressionable. He said that a well-to-do kid like him never should have been in the streets in the first place.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“Jay wanted to be a part of our life, our world, and he tried his best to be around and we allowed him to be around,” Watson said. “But it drowned him because it’s too deep.”</p>
		
		
		                <div class="image__ctn ">
		                    <img class="img" src="assets/images/jay/jay17.jpg" alt="jay17.jpg" />
		                    <div class="img__caption">jay17.jpg</div>
		                </div>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Watson rushed me off the phone, but not before adding this: “He died so young and he died in a situation that really had nothing to do with him. And in the end, the people that he was involved with, they didn’t really give a fuck about him to even care.”</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">The closest I would get to a complete picture of the circumstances of Jay’s death would come from the Herndon police department — though, again, vast chunks of my best friend’s story had been very literally erased.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">The official documents recounting the shooting and subsequent investigation landed in my inbox on July 1, more than 16 weeks after I first requested them. There were 162 pages in all, though many of them are redacted past the point of comprehensibility, often for no apparent reason. (For instance, they redacted nearly all mentions of Jay’s name, despite him being deceased and the subject of my request.)</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">As I started wading through the pages, a considerable part of me feared that they would merely reinforce the official story — and that, once and for all, I would have to come to terms with the fact that the smiling boy I once adored had grown up to be a dangerous criminal whose killing had been justified.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Instead, even through the redactions, the opposite emerged: There were glaring inconsistencies that either went ignored or uninvestigated by authorities.</p>
		
		
		                <div class="imgGroup__outer">
		                    <div class="imgGroup imgGroup2">

		                </div>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">The most important revelations, and ones never publicly reported, were that Jay was shot in the back and at point-blank range. Both would seemingly call into question the validity of Bennett killing him in self-defense.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">The reports noted gunpowder particles on the entrance wound on the shirt Jay was wearing revealed patterns consistent with the muzzle having been within 12 to 36 inches of the shirt when it was fired. An entrance bullet hole was in the back of Jay’s T-shirt and a possible exit hole in the front of the T-shirt, the reports said. (The documents attempted to redact all identifying characteristics of Jay, but one forensic report failed to black-out that Jay was wearing a black T-shirt linked to the entrance hole in the back and exit hole in front.)</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">In short, Jay had been shot in the back from as close as a foot away.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“That doesn’t sound like self-defense to me,” said Todd Zinicola, a friend from Reston who works as an attorney in Fairfax County, when I tried to make sense of what I was reading. “If this happened now, it probably would be different. There would be more public outrage for (Bennett) to be charged.”</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">The reports also revealed that Bennett told police he did not have a concealed weapon permit for his gun, a seemingly important fact that never made its way into newspaper reports of the incident. Bennett told police he carried a gun for personal protection and that he just happened to have it on him that night.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">It was a detail that never made much sense to Jay’s sister.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“This man was having a graduation party for his daughter — why the fuck do you feel like you have to be armed at a graduation party?” Christin told me. “If you have to be armed at a party you’re throwing for your kid, then you need to not just allow whoever to come.”</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Investigators never appeared to question why Bennett told someone to hide the gun after he shot Jay and Clay, or scrutinized his lack of a concealed weapon permit, according to the police reports.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Bennett also never fully explained what happened during a time gap just after the initial fight the night of the party, when a witness told police they observed Bennett drive away from the party and return 20 minutes later. Investigators noted in the reports they wanted to follow up and ask Bennett about that — presumably, it would appear, they wanted to ask if he went home to get his gun.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">But the follow up interview never took place, according to the police reports.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Bennett also told police he heard “numerous shots fired” before retaliating. Yet only one shell casing, besides the five others that came from Bennett’s gun, were recovered at the scene, according to the reports.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Bennett further claimed that he did not fire his gun outside of the clubhouse, according to the documents. Yet a witness told police they saw Bennett shoot Clay outside the clubhouse, and three shell casings from Bennett’s gun were found outside by the front porch.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Why was Bennett never scrutinized on these points? Investigators said they attempted to re-interview him more than a month after the shooting, but there’s no mention of another interview ever taking place. Bennett’s attorney, John Partridge, said he would discuss setting up the interview with Bennett and get back to police, records show.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Partridge, who did not return messages from NJ Advance Media seeking comment for this story, never called back police, according to the records.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">That detail lingered in my mind: Police had wanted to re-interview Bennett about “discrepancies” in his statements, yet they never did. I couldn’t understand how that would constitute a thorough investigation.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">There was one final baffling contradiction: On Dec. 2, 1999, Herndon police were informed Fairfax County Commonwealth’s Attorney Robert Horan Jr. would not be pursuing charges against Bennett because “it appeared Bennett was acting in self-defense,” according to the documents. The case was closed Dec. 3, 1999, the documents stated.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">But a week later, Horan Jr. told The Washington Post he had no knowledge of a press release from Herndon police announcing there would be no charges, adding “as far as I’m concerned, it’s not over.”</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Horan Jr., now 87, was unable to comment for this story when reached by phone.</p>

		                <p class="article_p">The second week of September, I called Peggy Randall and told her about my findings. She took in all the information, thinking carefully about what I was telling her. She had not known Jay was shot at point-blank range or that he was shot in the back. Herndon police, she said, had told her Bennett did in fact have a concealed weapon permit.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“It sounds like the person who spoke to me lied,” Peggy Randall said.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Her voice grew quiet, and she took long pauses. Then, she told me that she had always had suspicions Herndon police didn’t investigate her son’s shooting as thoroughly as they could have. But back then, she didn’t know what to do. She was forced to accept the findings of the investigation.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“I probably more than anything else wanted to move on because nothing was going to bring him back,” Peggy Randall told me. “But now I think I just want to know what really happened to Jay.”</p>

		            <h4 class="chapter__title Playfair_bold">7. New eyes on the case</h4>
		                <p class="article_p">Steve Descano pulled his chair to a mahogany table inside his neat, orderly office at the Fairfax (Va.) County Courthouse on a gray fall morning. Although just 39-years-old and with a youthful face, he’s one of the most heralded prosecutors in Virginia. Last year, running on a platform of social reform, Descano knocked off a 35-year incumbent in the Democratic primary on the way to securing his seat as Commonwealth’s Attorney in the state’s largest jurisdiction.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">After months of back and forth, Descano agreed to sit down with me to discuss my investigation into Jay’s shooting.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“What makes it difficult is that it’s such an old case, as well as it actually never became a case — because it was an incident that was never charged,” Descano told me almost as soon as we sat down. “It would be really difficult for me to go back and say, in a case that I didn’t touch, that this or that should have been done in particular.”</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Still, Descano seemed interested in hearing me out. I prodded him over the course of a roughly 30-minute interview, peppering him with questions about the case. I wanted to know if information I uncovered — like Jay being shot in the back — could prompt his office to reopen the case. At the very least, I asked if he could compel Herndon to give me an unredacted copy of the police report so I could further my investigation.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">At every turn, though, he sidestepped my entreaties.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">He said his office did not have authority to release the police reports.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">He declined to tell me what constitutes self-defense in Fairfax County, saying it wouldn’t be fair to the community.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">And he wouldn’t say whether any information I had found gave him any pause.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“I can’t really speak specifically to the case,” Descano told me, one way or another, again and again.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">The best I could get from him was a tacit acknowledgement that, in terms of getting a full and fair accounting of his death, Jay Randall likely never had much of a chance. After the shooting, a narrative about Jay and his killing had quickly formed in news reports — here was another troublemaking Black boy, who sold drugs and carried a weapon, and ultimately deserved what he got. And as we’ve seen play out countless times in American history — whether the Scottsboro Boys, or the Central Park Five, or the victims of New York City subway shooter Bernard Goetz — once such a narrative takes hold, both investigators and the public are rarely keen on closely examining it.</p>

		                </div>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“All victims deserve justice, and it doesn’t matter if a victim had a background that was checkered,” Descano told me. “That doesn’t mean their life is any less valuable than anyone else’s.”</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Descano — who some are eyeing as a possible future Governor or Senator of an increasingly left-leaning Virginia — lived up to everything I had read and heard about him: Earnest, sincere, and thoroughly committed to a progressive approach to policing and Black lives in the future.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">But at least for now, a reckoning with the past regarding Jay’s death would not be forthcoming from his office.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">The news was not unexpected, but still leveled me like a punch — what would it take for an official reexamination? From Descano’s office, I drove 45 minutes west into Fauquier County, a rural outpost nestled in the shade of the Blue Ridge Mountains, pursuing what I considered my final shot. I pulled off a two-lane highway and wound down a long, bucolic road, past cow pastures and farmhouses, finally pulling in front of a large home perched atop a hill. In the front yard, an elderly man in gray sweatpants and a navy ball cap sat on a riding lawn mower.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">It was Dennis Royal, the Herndon police detective who worked on Jay’s case. I had left several phone messages for Royal over the past few months, but he never responded. His silence had made me believe that maybe he knew more than was in the reports.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Speaking in a measured tone and with a hint of drawl, he seemed wary of my being there, telling me the incident was from a long time ago and difficult to recall. He seemed suspicious of my intentions, and made a wisecrack about my being from of New Jersey. He chortled when I mentioned visiting Descano that day, making it clear he wasn’t a fan of the new Commonwealth Attorney’s policies.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">But Royal kept talking. He told me he remembered evidence of gunfire going back and forth from the case, that it “wasn’t a mystery” who had shot Jay and that “you have a right to defend yourself.”</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">He told me repeatedly: “It came down to can you overcome the claim of self-defense? And I don’t think you could.”</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">I countered that Jay had been shot in the back, that Bennett didn’t have a concealed weapon permit — and that Royal had flagged discrepancies in the documents that he never was able to follow up on.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">But in Royal’s mind, there were no avenues left unexplored by the investigation.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“He was 16,” Royal said of Jay, near the end of our conversation. “Way too young, obviously. But I think you have to agree that he played a big hand in his demise.”</p>

		            <h4 class="chapter__title Playfair_bold">8. The reckoning</h4>
		                <p class="article_p">On May 25, about three months after I began my investigation into Jay’s death, George Floyd was killed by a Minneapolis police officer who was captured on cell phone video kneeling on his neck for more than eight minutes. Floyd’s murder sparked the largest social uprising in American history, with outraged citizens of all races and ages taking to the streets from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">For decades, minorities and allies have been fighting to bring attention to police brutality and systemic racism in the U.S. But only after Floyd’s death did it feel like the world actually started to listen. And as I watched these protests on television, and covered a number of them as a reporter, Jay was never far from my mind. How much had I been complicit in the erasure of my friend’s story, as a white person who never thought to rigorously question the police’s handling of Black victims? How might the case have unfolded differently today, in our era of cell phone video and omnipresent security cameras?</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">All of which perhaps explains why I put off for so long the trip I knew I would have to make, to visit Jay’s mother Peggy in person. When we had last spoken by telephone in August, after sharing with her new information I had uncovered, she told me that she just wanted to know the truth of what happened to Jay.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Now I was going to have to tell her that, as doggedly as I had tried, I still didn’t know.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">On October 28, a little after noon, I pulled in front of a brown townhouse in Reston, the place Jay’s family had moved after leaving Steeplechase Drive, the sidewalks and streets covered with fallen orange, red and yellow leaves. The last time I had been here was June 13, 1999. The day Jay died.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Peggy Randall was outside in her garage when I climbed from my car. We exchanged pleasantries; she asked about my mom and dad. And just as she had done nearly three decades before, when I’d go to Jay’s house to explore the woods in their backyard, build forts or make elaborate ice cream sundaes as she mostly laughed at our silliness, she was able to quickly put me at ease.</p>
		
		
		                <div class="image__ctn ">
		                    <img class="img" src="assets/images/jay/Jay68.jpg" alt="Jay68.jpg" />
		                    <div class="img__caption">Jay68.jpg</div>
		                </div>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Yet the question of whether she really wanted me there, or wanted me to be working on this story at all, hovered in the air, unresolved. Jay’s sister, Christin, was inside the house, having agreed to come over so that she could be photographed for this story.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">But Peggy warned me not to ask about her late brother.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“Whenever we get thinking a lot about Jay, she gets real down and depressed and tearful,” Peggy said.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Christin soon walked outside, polite, but distant. Since our first interview, she had never responded to my text messages or phone calls.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">She posed for some photos alongside her mother, then went back inside. Peggy told me that Jay’s death wrecked Christin more than anyone. In truth, she had never recovered.</p>
		
		
		                <div class="image__ctn ">
		                    <img class="img" src="assets/images/jay/Jay61.jpg" alt="Christin, Jay’s sister (right)." />
		                    <div class="img__caption">Christin, Jay’s sister (right).</div>
		                </div>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“To a large extent, Christin blames me,” Peggy said. “And so if we get into a conversation about Jay, it usually deteriorates. Because if I had done things differently, or if his dad, if things had been different. …”</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">I asked her: Does she think she could have done more?</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“Oh yeah,” Peggy said. “You may say don’t blame me. But no.”</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">She then repeated a story she had told me a couple times about when Jay started hanging around a new group of people in seventh grade. Peggy understood his new friends lived in low-income neighborhoods and came from troubled homes. She had reservations, of course, but their backgrounds also made her more emboldened to embrace them.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">It was as if, as a Black, educated suburbanite, she owed it to those kids, and her son, to give them a chance.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“Jay identified with them,” Peggy said. “And so because they were poor and lived in low-income housing, I didn’t want to say: ‘You can’t be friends with these kids.’ And I thought that we could have a positive influence on them. It didn’t turn out that way.”</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">We talked for a little while longer, about the challenges of being a teenager and how what a young man wants to make of his life just sort of clicks one day out of the blue. But eventually it came time for me to tell her what I wished I didn’t have to share: After reopening these old wounds and giving Peggy hope, I was throwing cold water on everything. It seemed clear after speaking with Descano that Jay’s case would not be getting any new attention.</p>
		
		
		                <div class="image__ctn ">
		                    <img class="img" src="assets/images/jay/Jay31.jpg" alt="Jay’s home?" />
		                    <div class="img__caption">Jay’s home?</div>
		                </div>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Peggy took the information in stride. She told me she had long ago tried to make peace with what happened to her son, and nothing she could do or say would bring him back.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“He had been back home, living here, and we really thought that he was growing up and he was going to get out of it,” Peggy said. “But he didn’t quite make it.”</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">I didn’t know what else to say. A part of me wanted to apologize, for asking her to relive all of this again. But a larger part of me knew that an apology would be disingenuous — because for 21 years I’ve known that, if I could do nothing else for my friend who slipped away, at the very least I would one day have to tell the story of Jay.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">We said our final goodbyes and I climbed back into my car, starting the short drive back to my parents’ house on Citation Court, the same home where my friendship with Jay first took shape.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">As I drove, my mind drifted, back to when we were 12. There we were, Jay and I, frozen in time, zooming down Steeplechase Drive on his purple Diamondback BMX bike — him pedaling, me clutching his shoulders and standing on the back pegs. We were belting out the lyrics to our favorite song, “Doggy Dog World” from Snoop Dogg’s first album.</p>

		                    <div class="lyric_inner">

		                <p class="article_p">Hours after my wife’s water broke on Sept. 12, 2015, it was finally time to go. We grabbed our bags, fired off a few texts to family members and rushed to Mountainside Hospital in Montclair, N.J. around 7 p.m. Our first baby was almost here.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">We settled into our birthing suite, and Jackie, my wife, pushed and pushed until 11:33 p.m. Then, following one more surge, he finally arrived: A perfect 7-pound, 13-ounce baby boy. The doctor placed him in my wife’s arms, as I watched in awe.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">The nurse came over and handed me a pen and paper to fill out the birth certificate. Jackie and I had scrutinized nursery colors, bottle types, strollers, daycares, even his first car seat.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">But this part had never been in question.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“So, what’s his name?” the nurse asked.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">I wrote it on the paper, giving it a long look, before handing it back.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“James,” I told her. “But we’ll call him Jay.”</p>
