		        <p class="article_p">Pennsylvania State Route 248 spans this crucial swing state county through all political subgroups. One end is in the city of Easton on the Delaware River, an urban area dependably for Democrats. The other end is 30 miles northwest in the reliably Republican rolling hills where the Lehigh River cuts through the Blue Mountain ridge.</p>
		        <p class="article_p">The two sides meet in the posh purple townships and industrial boroughs in between. Yard signs for Joe Biden transition to Donald Trump flags as the landscape morphs from urban townhouses to rural farmland, with suburban shopping centers and limestone quarries along the way.</p>
		        <p class="article_p">One trip on Route 248 reveals Northampton County’s clear divisions in the 2020 presidential election. Join us on our journey down a single road and see what drives voters in this swing county.</p>

		                    <p class="article_p">Northampton County could decide the 2020 presidential election. In the past century, the candidate chosen by Northampton County voters has assumed the presidency all but three times. It may once again serve as a bellwether for who gets Pennsylvania’s 20 electoral votes.</p>
		
		
		
		                    <p class="article_p">Take the past three elections, for example. Northampton County twice supported Democrat Barack Obama with 56% of the vote in 2008 and 52% in 2012. In 2016, it became one of only 206 counties in the nation to flip for Republican Donald Trump, giving him 50% of the local vote.</p>
		
		
		
		                    <p class="article_p">This is a county that political experts say generally encapsulates all of Pennsylvania within just 370 square miles. Compared with the rest of the state and nation, the 300,000 people who live here are generally a little older (the median age is 42), a little less diverse (about 76% white), make a little more money (the median household income is $68,500) and maybe a little more likely to own a home (72% of the local population).</p>
		
		
		
		                    <p class="article_p">But the picture varies greatly depending on where you view it. Just along our one road, the experiences that influence people’s politics run the gamut from the soul food kitchen owner in Easton, to a teacher living in Nazareth and a corporate retiree in the rural northern tier.</p>
		
		
		
		                    <p class="article_p">We’ll meet them on our way.</p>

It annually celebrates its role in America’s founding — the Declaration of Independence was read aloud in the main hub of Centre Square shortly after its signing — and reliably votes Democrat. The population here is the youngest and most diverse of anywhere on our route. The median age is just 34. More than 15% of Easton is Black and almost a quarter is Hispanic. There is a vibrant Lebanese community that holds an annual public church festival.</p>

		                    <p class="article_p">The stadium site is in Easton’s West Ward, a large community of row homes arranged in a neat grid of city blocks. Like the field, the West Ward has seen some tough times. It is all too often the scene of drug raids or violent crime. Easton may be young and diverse, but it also has our route’s highest poverty rate at 16.7%.</p>
		
		
		
		                    <p class="article_p">But there is much good to be found here. City and community leaders have for years emphasized revitalizing the West Ward. And the area’s diversity is seen as a strength, one that works in Biden’s favor.</p>
		
		
		
		                    <p class="article_p">Jerome Warren runs Yahbie’s Taste of Soul a few blocks from Easton’s border with Wilson Borough. Warren describes the community as racially “mixed-up,” in a good way, a place where people mostly get along. He sees and hears from all sorts of people in his kitchen, including some Trump supporters, but says this community leans Democrat – not necessarily because of Biden’s stances but due to economic instability and racial tension under Trump’s term.</p>

		                    <p class="article_p">“The whole racial thing that's going on, it's a big problem because [in] this area, this is a lot of mixed people,” says Warren, who is Black. The president, he continued, “touted on the economy. The economy is not doing well. You can't do well when you have racial tension because everybody’s got to get along with everybody.”</p>

But its votes vary – residents here supported Al Gore in 2000 but were on board with George W. Bush’s re-election in 2004; it went for Obama twice before flipping for Trump in 2016.</p>
		
		
		
		                    <p class="article_p">Lower Nazareth’s 6,000 people boast the highest median household income ($102,000), the lowest poverty rate (4%) and the highest percentage of college-educated residents (40%) of anywhere along Route 248. The township has gone for Republicans in every presidential election in the past 20 years.</p>

		                    <p class="article_p">This is a small borough of 5,700 people, nearly all of whom are white. But when it comes to picking presidents, this community – founded as a religious haven and built around blue-collar industry like the cement plants and now-defunct Nazareth Speedway – is a political battleground. It supported Al Gore in 2000, George W. Bush in 2004 and then backed Obama’s two terms before flipping for Trump in 2016.</p>

She has a Biden flag on her front porch. Her neighbor flies a Trump flag. “It's great that he has that opinion. That's one of our freedoms that our forefathers had fought for so long ago and I'm proud to keep that tradition alive, as I'm sure he is, too. That's what being an American is all about – difference of opinion and being able to be civil about it."</p>

The road passes a cemetery that overlooks a splendid vista that sees all the way to South Mountain on the far side of Bethlehem, eight miles away. The foreground is dominated by yet another cement plant.</p>

Bath was blue in the presidential election of 2000, turned red in 2004 for George W. Bush’s second term, flipped again for Obama in 2008, then supported the Republican Mitt Romney in 2012. It stayed red for Trump in 2016.</p>
		
		
		
		                    <p class="article_p">But if there was much support for Biden here now, it’s not very visible on our drive. “All aboard the Trump train,” says one Broad Street home’s banner, prominently staked in the front yard. Some are more crass (“Trump 2020: No more bullshit,” the flags say) and begin to appear more frequently along our route.</p>

This region is a stronghold for Northampton County Republicans. Gloria “Lee” Snover, who chairs the county GOP, says this region has been “smokin’” when it comes to voter registration in 2020.</p>
		
		
		
		                    <p class="article_p">These townships have consistently supported Republicans for president in the past 20 years, though some votes have been close. In 2008, John McCain won East Allen by just 20 votes and Lehigh Township by 174. In 2000, George W. Bush won Lehigh Township by 82 votes.</p>

The 70-year-old retiree has spent most of his life in the Lehigh Valley. He worked 40 years training managers in the fast-food industry, and another 10 at a Walgreen’s distribution center. He is confident the area will remain red and thinks Republicans are most likely to follow through on promises that will help people like him, like lowering property taxes.</p>
