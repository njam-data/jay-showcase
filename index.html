I was 17 and cooling off during my break as a lifeguard at a neighborhood pool down the street from my parents’ house in Reston, Virginia. I still recall that familiar rush of freedom, the heedless plunge into ice-cold water on a not-yet-hot day, that I would feel at the start of every summer.</p>

		                </div>
		
		                <p class="article_p">If I’m going to tell you the story of Jay Randall, I should start with the official record — the story that, at least until a few months ago, we all unquestioningly accepted.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">He was born on June 29, 1982, at Howard University Hospital in Washington, D.C., the youngest child to James and Peggy Randall, a lawyer and a human resources specialist, respectively. He had one sister, Christin, four years his elder. He was technically named James, after his father — though from the time he was a baby, everyone called him Jay.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">His family lived in a home off Steeplechase Drive, in one of the wealthier areas in Reston, a suburban enclave known for its diversity, quality schools and dense forests. His parents had been longtime residents of D.C., until just before Jay was born, when they relocated to the suburbs seeking more space for their growing family. Six years after that, my own family moved to a house on Citation Court, exactly one mile from Jay.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">From 1989 to 1995, we were inseparable, a Black kid and a white kid stomping through the creeks looking for crayfish, exploring miles of meandering paths on our bikes and spending our summers on the neighborhood Hunters Woods Blue Marlins swim team. He was inordinately confident, brash and wickedly funny — when he ran for sixth-grade class president, he won in a landslide. More than once back then, I fantasized that we would share all the same classes in high school and perhaps even go to college together.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">But at some point, things came unstrung for Jay. He started hanging out with teenagers and 20-somethings who lived in the blighted, subsidized housing complexes in Reston. He began selling and using drugs and carrying a gun.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">His life ended June 13, 1999, about 10 years after we first met, when Jay was 16. Police and news reports said Jay’s group of friends was involved in a fight at a high school graduation pool party. At some point, they were thrown out of the bash. They left and returned later with guns, seeking retribution against another group, according to news reports. Jay and friends made their way back to the party, an uproar ensued, and guns were fired. A 40-year-old man named Eddie Bennett who was hosting the celebration for his daughter pulled a handgun and shot Jay and a 21-year-old man, police said.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">I grieved his death for weeks, devastated and confused. I couldn’t comprehend how this person I cared for so deeply became this other person now being described in the media as a threat to decent people.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Yet everyone who knew Jay seemed to accept what investigators and the newspapers said happened. Bennett’s attorney was quoted in several articles touting his client as a hero who saved the day by firing back at the group of party-crashers — he had prevented “another Columbine,” the lawyer said. The case was closed less than six months later and no one was ever charged. Soon, Jay’s story became another cautionary tale whispered through town. His friends, the community and the world moved on, as if it all had been a vivid dream.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">I didn’t move on.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Yes, I grew up, went to college, pursued a career as a journalist, married and started a family — luxuries lost to Jay. But I never stopped thinking about my first best friend, never stopped wondering how things had gone so brutally astray. And I never stopped imagining that maybe the truth was otherwise, that perhaps there was another explanation for why he died.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Still, it took me more than two decades, after telling his story to my wife and friends and colleagues, and listening to their prodding to revisit the case, before I finally felt ready to do it. I guess on some level I was afraid of what the truth might bring, that once I started digging, I’d find something that ruined my memory of Jay. Even after I finally started reporting this story, there were multiple instances when I wondered if the effort was futile, or if I had any business prying into my friend’s history.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Here are some details the official narrative left out, which I uncovered over 11 months working on this story, a process that included interviews with more than two dozen of Jay’s friends, family members and associates, legal experts and public officials, as well as a careful review of heavily redacted police and forensic documents.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">The gun that killed Jay was fired 12 to 36 inches from his body, not from a farther distance as I long had assumed.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Bennett did not have a concealed weapon permit for his gun, despite the belief of many people I talked to — including Jay’s mother — that he did.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Investigators flagged Bennett’s statements for discrepancies, yet never appeared to follow up.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">And one other detail, buried deep in a forensic analysis report typed in neat blank ink, and then never referenced in any media coverage of Jay’s killing:</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">My childhood best friend — who had been killed in a purported act of self-defense — had not been shot in the chest, as Herndon police told reporters. He had, in fact, been shot in the back.</p>

		                </div>
		
		                <p class="article_p">It was the first day of school, the September air heavy with uncertainty. Jay Randall walked into Hunters Woods Elementary School, a backpack slung over his wiry shoulders. He rounded a corner, and that’s when I saw him, standing outside Mrs. Bullis’ second-grade classroom — our purgatory for the next nine months.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">We had met over the summer at the neighborhood pool. He was an average-sized kid, with light brown skin, handsome, even features and a box of curly black hair teetering atop his large, oval-shaped head. My 7-year-old self thought he resembled Christopher Reid from the hip-hop duo Kid ‘n Play.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Now he saw me walking toward him and he greeted me with that familiar, beaming smile — his whole face lifting and coming alive, his cheekbones popping out like tennis balls.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">And just like that, once Jay and I realized we were in the same class, our first-day-of-school anxieties melted.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">How do you explain why two grade-school boys become best friends, other than a mysterious combination of personality, temperament and ridiculous good fortune? For Jay and me, we just clicked. We were similar, easygoing kids who liked sports; we both had mom and dad at home; and we both toed a line of being mostly well-behaved, but with enough mischievousness to keep life interesting.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">During that first school year together, our class kept journals. I found mine earlier this year digging through cluttered boxes in my parents’ basement, almost perfectly intact. In December 1989, I wrote about the two of us going to a birthday party at Chuck E. Cheese and being deemed too big for the ball pit — presumably because we were taller than most kids.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">The following month, I wrote about Jay coming to my house after school to play, summing it up succinctly: “We’re going to have fun. Jay is nice.”</p>
		
		
		                <div class="imgGroup1">
		                    <div class="imgGroup__ctn_1">

		                </div>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">At the end of the school year, we were given sheets of paper with the header: “End of the year thoughts and opinions.” I drew a picture of Jay and me, standing side-by-side: Jay with his high-top fade like a pencil eraser, and me with half-drawn arms. No caption necessary.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">And so it went, two silly boys, ages 8 and then 9 and then 10. In a group picture from my third-grade birthday party, he dived on top of me and mugged for the camera, the biggest personality in a group of 10 boys. In fourth grade, I played trumpet in our school’s band, and Jay liked to carry the instrument into the street outside my house and toot obnoxiously while imploring neighbors to toss change into the open case.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">I still smile thinking about a fourth-grade class trip to Old Town Alexandria, a historic district along the Potomac River. Jay and I straggled at the back of the pack, playing a game to see who could leap highest and touch light poles and door frames. Suddenly, Jay jumped into the air and slapped a loose brick that came tumbling on his head. Blood trickled down his face, but instead of screaming, he cackled uncontrollably. I was horrified by his wound — yet I laughed hysterically in lockstep. Our chaperones and teacher were not similarly amused.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Jay often had that effect on me. His eyes could fill with such joy and goofiness that one well-timed glance could ignite a giggling fit. Scores of others in our school similarly were drawn to Jay. He even struck a friendship with our fourth-grade teacher, Rebecca Nellum Williams, who tutored him in reading and writing after Jay moved on to fifth grade. She knew Jay loved baseball, so she took the two of us to a Baltimore Orioles game in July of 1993.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“He was just a sweetheart,” Mrs. Williams told me earlier this year. “And his smile. I will never forget his smile.”</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">There was the obvious difference of our race, but that never seemed to be remarked upon, by each other or anyone we knew; certainly, there were other Black-white friendships in our school. I do remember being envious of his thick, curly hair, and I would beg him to let me slather it with Afro Sheen. I loved using his hair pick, the one with the handle forming a clenched fist, to brush out rough patches. I always thought Jay enjoyed this, too, but whether I was just being oblivious and insensitive, I’ll never know.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">We were set to graduate from sixth grade in June of 1994 and head for middle school. One day, my mom gently tried to warn me that my relationship with Jay could change. We would be going to a far bigger school. Jay may want to hang out with more Black kids, and I might make new friends, she told me.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“Jay and I will be best friends forever,” my mom recalled me saying. “Don’t even say such a thing.”</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">But Jay must have been worried, too. Because I remember an afternoon late that spring, when the two of us tagged along with his mom to the local high school while she worked the concession stand at Jay’s sister’s track meet. We killed time climbing the bleachers and scaling a metal gate on the far side of the stadium.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">And then, out of nowhere, Jay looked at me and said:</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“You’re going to leave me behind when we get to middle school. You’re going to forget about me.”</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">I scoffed.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“No way,” I told him.</p>

		                </div>
		
		                <p class="article_p">Peggy Randall, Jay’s mother, is a short, slight woman with a whisper-soft voice and a distinct motherly sweetness. She’s 74 now. When I called her in June, for the first in a series of conversations this year, she told me a story about Jay I never had heard — even though I would have been there at the time.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">It happened, she said, during an elementary school birthday party in Reston. For the first stretch of the bash, there were about 10 or so kids there — all but Jay were white.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">At some point, though, another group of kids walked past, all of them Black.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“Here come the Black kids,” Jay told Peggy he heard one of the white kids say, snideness in his voice, oblivious that Jay was standing nearby.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“It’s like Jay didn’t count as a Black kid to them,” Peggy Randall told me.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">To understand the story of Jay, you must understand where we grew up — a town that for much of the last century was nothing but undeveloped farmland. Until, that is, 1961, when Robert E. Simon, a young real estate entrepreneur, used proceeds from his family’s sale of Carnegie Hall to start building a pioneering planned community that insisted on walkability, density, access to nature and diversity of races and income levels. Simon named it “Reston” — derived from his “R.E.S.” initials.</p>
		
		
		                <div class="image__ctn ">

		                    <div class="img__caption">People spend a warm fall morning hanging out along Lake Anne Plaza in Reston. (Aristide Economopoulos | NJ Advance Media)</div>
		                </div>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">It was called the first “modern planned community,” and the idealism was poured right into the foundation. Simon envisioned a place that would be the first of its kind, a town that, perhaps, could help solve income disparity, poverty and generational racism.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">If you told my 10-year-old self all of this, I probably would have nodded and said, “Makes sense.” My best friend was Black. We spent our days swimming and fishing in four man-made lakes and tramping through 250 bountiful acres of woodlands. Our classrooms were a canvas of white and Black faces, along with kids from Pakistan, South Korea and Bolivia — the offspring of government workers in nearby Washington, D.C., or immigrants who lived in low-income housing.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">The reality, of course, was much more complicated — idylls usually are. In the early 1970s, community leaders in Reston actively sought to build subsidized housing for low-income families, a move that exemplified the hope that rich and poor can and should co-exist in the same community. One of the largest of these developments was Stonegate Village, a three-story, 240-unit complex built in 1972 — approximately one mile from my family’s house and two miles from Jay’s — that became home to a largely minority population of about 1,500 people.</p>
		
		
		                <div class="image__ctn ">
		                    <img class="img" data-src="assets/images/jay/jay37.jpg" alt="jay37.jpg A sign for the Stonegate Village Apartments in Reston.." />
		                    <div class="img__caption">The Stonegate Village Apartments in Reston.</div>
		                </div>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Within a few years, though, community leaders were complaining the housing brought with it “unexpected social and economic problems,” according to a 1978 Washington Post article. Residents argued the numerous low-income complexes in Reston were marred by unresponsive management and a lack of social programs. By the late 1980s, Stonegate had become one of Fairfax County’s main open-air drug markets, according to the Post, with little kids, some of whom undoubtedly were my classmates, serving as lookouts for dealers.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">For me, Stonegate was just another part of town, and I knew its residents well from school or basketball. I was close friends with many boys and girls who lived there, and I thought of their families as big-hearted and hard-working. Whatever crime or wrongdoing might have been happening in pockets there, it never penetrated my elementary-school consciousness.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">For Jay? That’s impossible to know, though as I reported this story, I kept coming back to the stark divisions contained within census data from Reston, available on city-data.com: The census quadrant that includes Stonegate is 73% Black, Hispanic or Asian, and 11% of residents live below the poverty line. The median home is $95,000.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">The quadrant Jay lived in is 87% white, 3% Black and the median home value is $721,000. (That data is derived from Reston today, but the community’s makeup is not much different from when Jay and I were growing up.)</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Jay’s sister, Christin Randall Dougherty, told me at times she grappled throughout childhood with a kind of identity crisis — the Randalls were among a handful of Black families I knew in elementary school who didn’t live in Stonegate or other low-income housing throughout Reston. Both Christin and Jay were light-skinned, so people constantly thought they were mixed-race, Christin said. And it seemed their skin color, dialect or where they lived was being pointed out constantly.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“Not by other whites — by Blacks,” Christin told me. “And it was confusing. ‘Am I not appreciating my ethnic, racial identity because most of my friends are white?’ I think (Jay) really felt that intensely. He just was so young that he was still in the thick of it, of trying to figure out who he was. You just don’t know would he have come to terms with, ‘I’m Black and I’m not from the hood and it’s OK.’”</p>

		                </div>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Looking back, Jay must have struggled with his identity, at least to judge from an incident near the end of sixth grade that I could never shake. My father drove us to the annual Reston Baseball Carnival, where Jay spotted another Black boy with whom he had scuffled on the playground at school. For reasons none of us understood, Jay and the boy decided to fight that night, and a huge crowd gathered to egg them on — this despite the fact that the Jay I knew never started or wanted anything to do with fights.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">He lost that brawl, getting tagged repeatedly in the face, as I stood nearby, judging whether to help. He called me later that night, surveying the damage in his bathroom mirror.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“I got beat up,” he told me, forlornly, but with a hint of pride in his voice. It made no sense to me at the time, but now I wonder if by fighting this other boy, he thought he might be able to shed the label of a soft kid from a nice part of town.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">We soon drifted apart, for no particular reason. I swore I wouldn’t let that happen, but of course it did. In seventh grade, the first year of middle school, I made the Reston travel basketball team. I practiced nearly year-round and started spending almost every free moment with teammates or the boys in my neighborhood. Jay joined the Reston youth football team, where his mom said he started hanging out with more Black kids from the lower-income parts of town, including Stonegate.</p>

		                </div>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“He didn’t even want (his other Black friends) to know he was also on the swim team,” Peggy Randall said. “It was like his whole mindset and attitude changed.”</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“You guys were best friends and you went to the pool together all the time and went over to each other’s houses,” Christin told me. “And then in middle school it was just as if you and others he had gone to elementary school with didn’t exist.”</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">We still occasionally hung out. But once the experimentation of early adolescence commenced — rolling low-grade weed in Phillies blunts and swigging convenience store booze in the woods we once explored on our bikes — our friendship was very much in the past tense. Jay had his crew. I had mine.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">As it turned out, there likely was another reason I started seeing less of Jay — though it was one I never would have imagined at the time.</p>

		                </div>
		
		                <p class="article_p">I always had known Jay became a drug dealer — it had been rumored throughout high school, and it had been widely documented in the newspaper reports following his death.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">I just didn’t realize he had become one of the biggest drug dealers in Reston.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Pat McClafferty, a friend of Jay’s who still lives in suburban Virginia, told me Jay started selling crack around age 14, after they stumbled upon a huge stash hidden in a thicket of bushes near Stonegate. They took the crack and divided it with two other friends to sell, McClafferty said.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“Jay really got on the grind hard with his portion, and he became what we knew of Jay before he left us,” McClafferty said. “All that innocent stuff went out the door.”</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Person after person told me the same thing: In seemingly no time, my friend became one of the biggest drug dealers in Reston, a kid known on the streets as “Baby Jay” for his boyish appearance and extraordinarily young age in the trade.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Sam Jackson, another close friend of Jay’s, told me he moved away from Reston around 1996 and returned a year later to find Jay had become a kingpin of sorts. Jackson told me a visit to his friend’s house was like walking through a scene in a movie; Jay pulled out thick wads of cash and large stacks of drugs unlike anything he had seen.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“He was probably 14, and he had at least $5,000 on him,” Jackson said. “A super knot (of rolled up money) and a whole bunch of drugs. … He was the man. Like, he was the dude with the drugs.”</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Despite my best efforts, and for as many people as I talked to about Jay, no one could quite explain the meteoric nature of his rise. Some told me Jay kept his moves close, and also that one’s connections weren’t something you openly discussed.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Others said Jay made his initial entreaties into selling drugs in Stonegate, where he learned the trade from other, older dealers who he eventually would surpass in earnings.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“That boy had thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars,” said Ebony Sheppard, a woman four years older than Jay who told me she sold drugs with him and later let him live with her. “When Jay came out of his shell, Jay was gangster.”</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Sheppard said Jay’s success stemmed from selling not only to addicts in the housing projects, but also to wealthy clients he knew from his strait-laced days. He also was able to save money, she and Jackson said, by not needing to spend it on shoes, clothes and food, which his parents provided. That money he saved, Sheppard and others said, went to buy larger quantities of drugs he could resell.</p>
		
		
		                <div class="image__ctn ">
		                    <img class="img" data-src="assets/images/jay/jay40.jpg" alt="A path at night time between buildings in the Stonegate Village Apartments in Reston." />
		                    <div class="img__caption">The Stonegate Village Apartments in Reston, and the paths connecting the buildings, was where Jay first began selling drugs, friends said.</div>
		                </div>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">He became so successful, Jackson told me, that at least one notorious fellow dealer from Stonegate pleaded with the then-15-year-old Jay for drugs to sell.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“(The other dealer) was an O.G. to us, and he was begging Jay to buy shit off him,” Jackson said. “That blew my mind.”</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">As Jay found greater success dealing, his distaste for school and authority intensified, according to his parents. Jay’s father, James Randall, died in 2014, but before he passed away, he wrote a paper titled, “Why Did Jay Die?” The two-page piece, written like a clinical research study, explored what pushed Jay to the streets. The elder Randall surmised that a learning disability made it difficult for Jay to succeed in school, prompting teachers to funnel him into classes with other “non-academic types … usually from the lower socio-economic rungs.”</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">He continued: “He liked the fast life. He apprenticed well with older outlaws. Within a few years, he [attained] … even a certain degree of celebrity among the youth in the Reston area.”</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">James’ conclusion reads at once like the clear-eyed assessment of a clinician and the howl of despair of a father who watched his son slip away.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“How could values relating to hard work, nose to the grindstone perseverance, and hopeful, gradual advancement possibly compete with the concrete and immediate rewards he was reaping from outlaw culture?” he wrote.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">We entered South Lakes High School as freshmen in 1996, and soon saw the end of our time in school together. One day that winter, Jay got into an altercation next to the freshman lockers with one of our classmates, a nice boy not known for bad behavior. It wasn’t the first time Jay had been in trouble at South Lakes, but he was suspended and soon left for good.</p>

		                <p class="article_p">He bounced between alternative schools, still misbehaving or skipping. It was around this time, in 1996, that Jay was arrested for the first time and taken to the Fairfax County Juvenile Detention Center, his mom said. Peggy Randall couldn’t recall the specific reason for the first arrest, or others that followed. But, according to a reference in the police reports from the shooting, he was arrested roughly a half-dozen times for selling and possessing drugs, destruction of property, larceny, burglary and domestic assault. (It’s not known if he was ever charged; Virginia’s juvenile records are not subject to public records requests.)</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Sometime early in 1998, when Jay would have been a sophomore in high school, he missed a court-imposed curfew and faced 30 days in the lockup, and his mom said he all but vanished for about a year.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“I’d be constantly anxious,” Peggy Randall told me. “And then I’d imagine him coming to the door, coming home. But that didn’t happen. He stayed out there.”</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Christin Randall Dougherty, then in college, feared for her younger brother. On a visit home, she realized Jay had been gone for weeks, so she jumped in her car and drove around Reston for hours until she found him in one of the low-income housing developments and brought him home.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“He obviously didn’t stay,” Christin said. “He thought this life was exciting, and it killed him.”</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">It’s not clear what Jay was doing or where he lived during his time away. But it appears he continued to sell drugs, lived with various older women and crashed with friends, his mom and friends told me. From time to time, he would call his mom, just to let her know he was “alive and well enough,” she said.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Each time Jay appeared in the Fairfax County Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court, the judge never seemed to know what to do with him, Peggy Randall said.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“The judge would just give him a stern talking to and say, ‘Go home and behave yourself. You’ve got a good family,’” she recalled.</p>

		                <p class="article_p">Sometime during the year before his death, Jay began having problems with other dealers, according to his mother. During his brief stays at home, he seemed paranoid, warning his mother not to let anybody in the house she didn’t know, and asking if anyone had been looking for him.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">It was around this same time — circa spring or summer 1998 — that three of Jay’s friends told me he was attacked by an older rival. Some people said the rival robbed Jay of money or drugs, but they weren’t certain. Sheppard described the rival as an older man jealous of Jay’s success; she claimed the man slapped Jay in front of a group of people. (The man, now imprisoned in West Virginia, did not respond to a letter I sent seeking an interview.) The altercation left Jay bitterly embarrassed, Sheppard said.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">As a result, some time around November 1998, Jay took the next leap in the street life, friends told me: He got a gun — a silver AMT Model Back Up 9mm Luger. He told his friends he needed it for protection. It was one of the same guns found at the scene of his death.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Jay was released from juvenile detention for the final time in early 1999 and moved home around March of that year, Peggy Randall said. A brief period of hope followed. Jay seemed to listen when his parents would ask him to turn down his music, and they were bickering less. He also had gotten his high school equivalency degree while in jail, and his sister helped him take classes to land a job as a lifeguard.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">I remember seeing his name on the master lifeguard roster that June, totally shocked but also thrilled. We had drifted apart, and I had almost no idea at the time how desperate things had gotten for Jay, but maybe now we’d come together again. I imagined hanging out, bringing him along to lifeguard parties, riding around together in my boxy Volvo, a more grown-up version of our old best buddy routine.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">He was shot to death about a week later.</p>

		                <p class="article_p">By most accounts, Eddie Bennett, who is Black, was a typical suburban dad. He lived with his family in a brick home on a quiet, tree-lined street in Sterling, Virginia, a town eight miles northwest of Reston. He worked in the auto business and dabbled in baseball card sales, according to The Washington Post.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">On Saturday, June 12, 1999, Bennett, then 40, and other family members hosted a party for Bennett’s daughter, Shauntai, who was graduating from Park View High, a public school in Sterling. They picked the Four Seasons Pool and Clubhouse, an unremarkable, two-story facility in nearby Herndon. The place, including its second-floor entertainment area, could be rented for private parties, and the Bennetts had it from 8 p.m. to 1 a.m., making plans for a DJ and music, and circulating fliers touting the bash, according to the police reports. Guests were asked to pay $2 to defray costs.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">The questions of how and why Jay ended up at that party — and had his subsequent fatal encounter with Bennett — are ones no one could entirely answer for me.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Jay spent the early part of that Saturday in Reston at the house of a friend, Chandra Owen. She said Jay originally was planning to go to the Herndon Festival — an annual celebration with rides, live music and carnival games. But after leaving Owen’s house around dusk, he stopped in a Reston neighborhood known as Cedar Ridge, then headed to Herndon with a group of three or four older men he didn’t normally spend much time with, friends told me.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">It’s not clear if Jay’s group went to the festival, but they did end up at the graduation party around 9 p.m., according to police reports. Both Peggy Randall and Owen said they thought Jay knew Shauntai Bennett, and they believe he was an invited guest. News reports said Jay’s group had not been invited to the bash.</p>

		                    <div class="img__caption">The swimming pool at the Four Seasons hotel.</div>
		                </div>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">The first skirmish erupted almost immediately. One of the men with Jay spotted a rival, according to Byron Stafford, a witness at the party. There was bad blood between the groups, according to police documents, involving a member of one faction testifying against a member of the other faction in a federal drug case. The rival’s brother or relative, who was at the party, also was the same man who slapped Jay the previous year, friends told me.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">The two groups headed outside to fight near a dumpster. As they made their way out, several unknown males swooped in and attacked one or more of the people with Jay, according to police documents.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Eddie Bennett called police, who arrived in squad cars and broke up the crowd around 10:30 p.m., records show.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">That should have been the end of it.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">A witness told police they saw Bennett hop in his vehicle, drive away from the clubhouse and return about 20 minutes later.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Jay’s group also left. One man in his group was furious and barked about returning to the party and getting even, a witness told me. (The man did not respond to several phone and text messages and emails seeking comment for this story.) The group traveled to the house of a man named Moe Trammel in Herndon. There, according to Trammel, the man continued to stew over the earlier beating.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">At some point, Ebony Sheppard, Jay’s friend, said he or the people with him called her about unlocking her Reston home so Jay could collect the gun he kept there. Sheppard said she told them no, but that another person living at the home must have opened the door.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Sometime after 11 p.m., a group of about seven people — including Jay, Trammel and the man angered by the earlier beating — hopped in two cars and headed back to the party, this time armed with weapons, Trammel said. Jay was carrying his silver 9mm handgun, Trammel told me.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">The intention never was to shoot or kill anybody, but “more just to try to scare somebody,” Trammel said. None of Jay’s friends knows his true motivation for returning to the party armed. Sheppard and others believe something happened earlier — perhaps an altercation or personal threat. Other friends presume it may have been another example of Jay trying to prove himself to the older men.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Jay and the others returned to the clubhouse around 11:40 p.m., records show.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">The group strode toward the front entrance, a small foyer with stairs leading up to the second floor, police reports said. Partygoers, sensing trouble, began rushing toward the door, presumably to block them from entering, witnesses told police. Jay, carrying a gun wrapped in a red bandana, according to two witnesses and police records, immediately pushed his way into the foyer and staircase area, where partygoers were jostling.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Then, gunshots rang out.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">And that’s the point at which accounts differ. Bennett told police one of the intruders raised his gun and pointed it at someone; police reports redacted whoever this might have been. Byron Stafford, a friend of Jay’s at the party, said he saw Jay lift his gun before he was tackled from behind by an unknown man.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Peggy Randall said she was told by police that Jay was tussling with a nephew of Bennett’s.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">At some point, Jay fired his gun straight above his head and into the ceiling, according to Trammel and police reports. Trammel said he thought Jay shot into the roof to disperse the crowd.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Police recovered one bullet that was fired from Jay’s gun at the scene, records show.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Bennett fired five times, according to the police reports, hitting Jay once.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">(Eddie Bennett did not answer his door or respond to the letter I left for him in June, or to a later phone message seeking comment for this story.)</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">After this initial volley of shots, Jay sprinted from the clubhouse, a hole blasted through his torso, spurting blood on the walls and floor, according to witnesses and police records.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Bennett also headed toward the front of the clubhouse, according to police reports. He was attempting to close the front door, he told police, when an unidentified witness said they saw Robert Clay, a man thought to have been with Jay’s group, outside the clubhouse, “holding his arm behind his leg.” They believed Clay was armed and reaching for a weapon, the witness told police.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Again, Bennett fired, the witness said. The shot ripped into Clay, and he fell to the ground. Bennett then gave his gun to someone at the party, and that person hid it under the DJ’s turntable, a witness told investigators.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">As best as can be gleaned from the heavily redacted police reports, there’s no mention of Clay definitively carrying a gun that night. It’s not clear if Clay was with Jay’s group, but the two knew each other, friends told me.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Meanwhile, Jay found his way into the parking lot. Two friends, Stafford and T.J. Fobbs, peeled away in Fobbs’ mother’s white Hyundai Elantra as Jay waved them down, the men told me.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Fobbs roared toward Reston Hospital Center, his left hand gripping the steering wheel and his right applying pressure to Jay’s wound. Stafford sat in the backseat, screaming for Fobbs to run red lights. Jay groaned and his eyes rolled back in his head, the men told me.</p>

		                <p class="article_p">They made the 3.6-mile drive to the hospital in what felt like the blink of an eye, they said. Stafford and Fobbs leapt out, lifted Jay from the front seat and carried him inside.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">The wound was too severe to be treated at Reston Hospital. Instead, Jay was flown to the trauma center at Inova Fairfax Hospital.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">He survived emergency surgery.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">But he died Sunday morning at 7:38 a.m.</p>

		                <p class="article_p">The modest town home with white clapboard siding and pale blue shutters was almost hidden on a narrow, car-lined street in Bowie, Maryland, a city about 15 miles northeast of Washington, D.C. I had been trying to contact Robert Clay for months, but he never responded to my texts, phone calls or emails.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">I pulled up to his house on a sunny day in June, in the middle of a global pandemic. I took a deep breath, headed down a small concrete walkway and knocked on the door. A squat man with thinning hair and a thick beard, wearing gray athletic shorts and a gray tank top, opened the door.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Robert Clay, the man shot that night but who survived.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">He knew who I was. He had seen or heard some of my messages. But he politely refused, repeatedly, my pleading for a formal, on-the-record interview. And he kept asking me the same question, over and over.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“Why do you care?”</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">I told him I wanted to tell the real story of what happened to my friend, and that I was having trouble making sense of everything.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">We chatted there on his porch for nearly an hour, discussing everything that happened that night and how it affected his life. But no matter how hard I tried, I could not convince him to go on the record and be a part of the story.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">I never imagined I would have trouble finding people willing to talk about Jay. After all, I’m from Reston, born and raised — I grew up in the same place as many of the people in this story. I assumed that some of them, at the very least, would want for Jay to be afforded the basic dignity of a fair and honest accounting of his death.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">But a day after leaving Clay’s house, I tried to find the man involved in the initial fight the night of the shooting, who several of Jay’s friends told me should know better than anyone what happened. He never responded to phone and text messages and emails, nor when I reached out to a family member through social media.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Other friends of Jay’s — including three people rumored to be with him the night of his death — either didn’t respond to my numerous messages or declined to make themselves available for interviews.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">I did manage to reach Chris Watson, a Reston native from Stonegate who had taken Jay under his wing. He told me he was in jail when Jay was killed. Yet when I asked for help finding people who had been with Jay the night of his death, he told me I was wasting my time.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“As far as all the names that you have, I doubt anyone is going to talk to you, to really be honest with you,” Watson said. “This shit right here is not something that people want to go back on.”</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Watson said Jay had been drawn to the flashy life selling drugs in Stonegate, that he was young and impressionable. He said a well-to-do kid like him never should have been in the streets in the first place.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“Jay wanted to be a part of our life, our world, and he tried his best to be around and we allowed him to be around,” Watson said. “But it drowned him because it’s too deep.”</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Watson rushed me off the phone, but not before adding: “He died so young and he died in a situation that really had nothing to do with him. And in the end, the people that he was involved with, they didn’t really give a fuck about him to even care.”</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">The closest I would get to a complete picture of the circumstances surrounding Jay’s death would come from the Herndon police department — though, again, chunks of my best friend’s story literally had been blacked out.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">The official documents recounting the shooting and subsequent investigation landed in my inbox on July 1, more than 16 weeks after I requested them. There were more than 100 pages in all, though many are redacted past the point of comprehension, often for no apparent reason. (For instance, they redacted nearly all mentions of Jay’s name, despite him being the subject of my request.)</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">As I waded through the pages, I started to fear they would merely reinforce the official story. Instead, even through the redactions, something surprising emerged: There were discrepancies referenced by police that appeared to never be fully investigated.</p>

		                <p class="article_p">The most important revelations, and ones never publicly reported, were that Jay was shot in the back at point-blank range. But in virtually all the newspaper stories I found from the incident, Herndon police said Jay had been shot in the chest. Those three details would seemingly call into question the original narrative of the shooting.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">The reports noted gunpowder particles on the entrance wound on Jay’s shirt, suggesting the muzzle was 12 to 36 inches away when fired. The entrance hole was in the back of Jay’s T-shirt and a possible exit hole was in the front of the T-shirt, the reports said. (The documents attempted to redact all identifying characteristics of Jay, but one forensic report did not black-out that Jay was wearing a black T-shirt linked to the entrance hole in the back and exit hole in front.)</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">In short, Jay had been shot in the back from as close as a foot away.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“That doesn’t sound like self-defense to me,” said Todd Zinicola, a friend from Reston who works as an attorney in Fairfax County, when I tried to make sense of what I was reading. “If this happened now, it probably would be different.”</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">The reports also revealed that Bennett told police he did not have a concealed weapon permit for his gun, a fact that never made its way into newspaper reports of the incident. Bennett told police he carried a gun for personal protection and that he just happened to have it on him that night.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">It was a detail that never made much sense to Jay’s sister.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“This man was having a graduation party for his daughter — why the fuck do you feel like you have to be armed at a graduation party?” Christin asked. “If you have to be armed at a party you’re throwing for your kid, then you need to not just allow whoever to come.”</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">According to the investigative reports provided by Herndon police, investigators did not appear to question why someone took Bennett’s gun and hid it after Bennett shot Jay and Clay. Police also did not appear to scrutinize Bennett’s lack of a concealed weapon permit, according to what’s documented in the investigative reports.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">It’s impossible to know if these and other crucial points were further questioned by police beyond what’s documented in the reports they provided through a public records request. Herndon police did not respond to an email seeking comment for this story.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Bennett also never fully explained in the police reports what happened during a time gap just after the initial fight the night of the party, when a witness told police they saw him drive away from the party and return 20 minutes later. Investigators noted in the reports they wanted to follow up and ask Bennett about that — but the follow-up interview was not documented as ever taking place.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">The records also show Bennett telling police he heard “numerous shots fired” before retaliating. Yet only one shell casing, in addition to the five that came from Bennett’s gun, was recovered at the scene.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Bennett further claimed he did not fire his gun outside of the clubhouse, according to the documents. Yet a witness told police they saw Bennett shoot Clay outside the clubhouse, and three shell casings from Bennett’s gun were found outside by the front porch, according to the police reports.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Was Bennett ever pressed on these points?</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Investigators said they attempted to re-interview him more than a month after the shooting, but there’s no mention of another interview ever taking place. Bennett’s attorney, John Partridge, said he would discuss setting up the interview with Bennett and get back to police, records show.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Partridge, who did not return a phone message seeking comment for this story, never called back police, according to the records. If Partridge did call back investigators at some point, it was not noted in the reports provided.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">(In 2003, four years after the shooting, Partridge was suspended from practicing law in Virginia for 30 months, after a state disciplinary board ruled he had mishandled at least 10 cases since 1998, according to the Connection Newspapers. He no longer appears to actively practice law.)</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">There was one final baffling contradiction: On Dec. 2, 1999, Herndon police were informed Fairfax County Commonwealth’s Attorney Robert Horan Jr. would not be pursuing charges against Bennett because “it appeared Bennett was acting in self-defense,” according to the documents. The case was closed, according to a report dated Dec. 3, 1999.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Herndon police said in a news release on Dec. 9, 1999, that no charges would be filed but did not elaborate on why, according to The Washington Post. The release said it was Horan’s decision not to prosecute.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">But in the same story, Horan told the Post he had no knowledge of a news release from Herndon police announcing there would be no charges, adding “as far as I’m concerned, it’s not over.”</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">The Post story also noted Horan “repeatedly directed Herndon police to do additional investigation.”</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Horan, now 88, was unable to comment for this story when reached by phone.</p>

She took in all the information, thinking carefully about what I was telling her. She had not known Jay was shot at point-blank range or that he was shot in the back.

		                <p class="article_p">As we chatted, her voice grew quiet, and she took long pauses. Then, she told me that she had always had suspicions Herndon police didn’t investigate her son’s shooting as thoroughly as they could have. But back then, she didn’t know what to do.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“I probably more than anything else wanted to move on because nothing was going to bring him back,” Peggy Randall told me. “But now I think I just want to know what really happened to Jay.”</p>

		                </div>
		
		                <p class="article_p">Steve Descano pulled his chair to a mahogany table inside his tidy office at the Fairfax (Va.) County Courthouse on a gray fall morning. Although just 39 years old and with a youthful face, he’s one of the most heralded prosecutors in Virginia. Last year, running on a platform of social reform, Descano knocked off a 35-year incumbent in the Democratic primary on the way to securing his seat as commonwealth’s attorney in the state’s largest jurisdiction.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“What makes it difficult is that it’s such an old case, as well as it actually never became a case — because it was an incident that was never charged,” Descano told me almost as soon as we sat down. “It would be really difficult for me to go back and say, in a case that I didn’t touch, that this or that should have been done in particular.”</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Still, Descano seemed interested to hear me out and allowed me to prod him with questions over the course of a roughly 30-minute interview. I wanted to know if information I discovered — Jay being shot in the back, Bennett’s lack of a concealed weapon permit and the seemingly unanswered questions in the original investigation — could prompt his office to reopen the case. At the very least, I asked if he could compel Herndon to give me an unredacted copy of the police report so I could further my investigation.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">At every turn, though, he sidestepped my entreaties.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">He said his office did not have authority to release the police reports.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">He declined to tell me what constitutes self-defense in Fairfax County, saying it wouldn’t be fair to the community.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">And he wouldn’t say whether any information I had found gave him pause.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“I can’t really speak specifically to the case,” Descano told me, one way or another, again and again.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">The best I could get from him was an acknowledgement that the way Jay Randall had been portrayed in the media was “unfortunate.” After the shooting, a narrative about Jay and his killing had quickly formed in news reports — that here was a Black teen, who sold drugs and carried a weapon, and ultimately got his comeuppance.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">And as we’ve seen play out countless times in American history, once such a narrative takes hold, neither investigators nor the public is keen on closely examining it.</p>
		
		
		                <div class="image__ctn ">

		                </div>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“All victims deserve justice, and it doesn’t matter if a victim had a background that was checkered,” Descano told me. “That doesn’t mean their life is any less valuable than anyone else’s.”</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Yet at least for now, a reckoning with the past regarding Jay’s death would not be forthcoming from his office.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">The news was not unexpected, but still leveled me like a punch — what would it take for an official re-examination?</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">From Descano’s office, I drove 45 minutes west into Fauquier County, a rural outpost nestled in the shade of the Blue Ridge Mountains, pursuing what I considered my final shot. I pulled off a two-lane highway and wound down a long, bucolic road, past cow pastures and farmhouses, finally pulling in front of a large home perched atop a hill. In the front yard, an elderly white man in gray sweatpants and a navy ballcap sat on a riding lawn mower.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">It was Dennis Royal, the Herndon police detective who worked on Jay’s case. I had left phone messages for Royal over the past few months, but he never responded. I wondered if he might know more than was included in the police reports.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Speaking in a measured tone and with a hint of drawl, he told me the incident was from a long time ago and difficult to recall. He seemed suspicious of my intentions, and made a wisecrack about my being from New Jersey. He chortled when I mentioned visiting Descano, making a comment that indicated he wasn’t a fan of his policies.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">But Royal kept talking. He told me he remembered evidence of gunfire going back and forth from the case, that it “wasn’t a mystery” who had shot Jay and that “you have a right to defend yourself.”</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">He told me repeatedly: “It came down to can you overcome the claim of self-defense? And I don’t think you could.”</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">I countered that Jay had been shot in the back, that Bennett didn’t have a concealed weapon permit — and that Royal had flagged discrepancies in the documents that he never was able to follow up on, at least according to the police reports provided.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">But, in Royal’s mind, there were no avenues left unexplored by the investigation.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“He was 16,” Royal said of Jay, near the end of our conversation. “Way too young, obviously. But I think you have to agree that he played a big hand in his demise.”</p>

		                </div>
		
		                <p class="article_p">On May 25, about three months after I began my examination of Jay’s death, George Floyd was killed by a Minneapolis police officer who was captured on cellphone video kneeling on his neck for more than eight minutes. Floyd’s murder sparked one of the largest social uprisings in American history, with outraged citizens of all races and ages taking to the streets from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">As I watched these protests on television and covered a number of them as a reporter, Jay was never far from my mind. How might the case have unfolded differently today, in our era of cellphone video and omnipresent security cameras? How much had I been complicit in the erasure of my friend’s story, as a white person who never thought to rigorously question the police’s handling of Black victims?</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Was I righteous in now trying to “solve” this case and right a past wrong, or selfish and oblivious in reopening the old wounds of Jay’s friends and family?</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">I was thinking about all of it as I drove toward my final stop to visit Jay’s mother, Peggy Randall. We had spoken over the phone several times this year, but I had not seen her face to face in more than 15 years.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">On Oct. 28, a little after noon, I pulled in front of a brown town house in Reston, the place Jay’s family had moved after leaving Steeplechase Drive. The last time I had been to the house was June 13, 1999. The day Jay died, when I had driven over with my mom and a friend to express our condolences.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Peggy was in her garage when I arrived. We exchanged pleasantries; she asked about my mom and dad. And just as she had done nearly three decades before, when I’d go to Jay’s house to explore the woods in their backyard, build forts or make elaborate ice cream sundaes as she laughed at our silliness, she was able to quickly put me at ease.</p>
		
		
		                <div class="image__ctn ">

		                </div>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Jay’s sister, Christin, was inside the house, having agreed to come over so that she could be photographed for this story.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">But Peggy warned me not to ask about her late brother.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“Whenever we get thinking a lot about Jay, she gets real down and depressed,” Peggy said.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Christin, now 42, soon walked outside, polite, but distant. Since our first interview in March, she had never responded to my follow-up text messages or phone calls.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">She posed for some photos alongside her mother and then went back inside to work. Peggy told me that Jay’s death wrecked Christin more than anyone.</p>
		
		
		                <div class="image__ctn small">
		                    <img class="img" data-src="assets/images/jay/jay61.jpg" alt="Peggy Randall, left, and her daughter, Christin Randall Dougherty, look out the front door at Peggy Randall’s home in Reston." />

		                </div>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“To a large extent, Christin blames me,” Peggy said. “And so if we get into a conversation about Jay, it usually deteriorates. Because if I had done things differently, or if his dad, if things had been different ….”</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">I asked Peggy: Does she think she could have done more?</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“Oh yeah,” she said. “You may say don’t blame me. But no.”</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">She then repeated a story she had told me about when Jay started hanging around a new group of people in seventh grade. Peggy understood some of his new friends lived in low-income neighborhoods and came from troubled homes. She had reservations, of course, but their backgrounds also made her more emboldened to embrace them.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">It was as if, as a Black, educated suburbanite, she owed it to those kids, and her son, to give them a chance.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“Jay identified with them,” Peggy said. “And so because they were poor and lived in low-income housing, I didn’t want to say: ‘You can’t be friends with these kids.’ And I thought that we could have a positive influence on them. It didn’t turn out that way.”</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">We talked for a little while longer, about the challenges of being a teenager and how what a young man wants to make of his life just sort of clicks one day out of the blue. Eventually, the conversation shifted back to Jay, and to the frustrating lack of resolution in my reporting.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">I still didn’t know what exactly happened the night he died, but I had found that, at seemingly every turn, the circumstances surrounding Jay’s death appeared to have been flawed. Crucial details about the shooting never made it into public domain. The attorney who framed the entire media narrative about the incident later had his law license suspended. Even the commonwealth’s attorney at the time, according to the records and news reports, appeared to contradict the status of the investigation.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">And yet the case most likely would never formally be re-examined.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Peggy seemed to take the information in stride. She told me she had long ago tried to make peace with what happened to her son, realizing nothing she could do or say would bring him back.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“He had been back home, living here, and we really thought that he was growing up and he was going to get out of it,” Peggy said. “But he didn’t quite make it.”</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">Does she wish I had let his story be, instead of trying to find answers that likely never were going to come?</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“It’s hard for a lot of parents to understand when you don’t have control over your kid,” Peggy said, her voice growing somber. “And so I’ve kind of said: ‘He’s gone, I can’t bring him back and I can’t see how anything is going to reflect well on me as a parent.’”</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">She continued, “So, I’m not real excited about reading (the story) and sharing it because it wasn’t good. It was nothing that I’m proud of.”</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">We said our final goodbyes and I climbed back into my car, starting the short drive back to my parents’ house, the same home where my friendship with Jay blossomed 31 years ago. As I drove, my mind drifted, as it often does when I’m in Reston, back to when we were 12. There we were, Jay and I, frozen in time, zooming down Steeplechase Drive on his purple Diamondback BMX bike — him pedaling, me clutching his shoulders and standing on the back pegs. We were belting out the lyrics to our favorite song, “Doggy Dog World” from Snoop Dogg’s first album.</p>

		                <p class="article_p">Hours after my wife’s water broke on Sept. 12, 2015, it was finally time to go. We grabbed our bags, fired off a few texts to family members and rushed to Mountainside Hospital in Montclair around 7 p.m. Our first baby was almost here.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">We settled into our birthing suite and Jackie pushed and pushed until 11:33 p.m. Then, following one more surge, he finally arrived: A perfect 7-pound, 13-ounce boy. The doctor placed him in my wife’s arms as I watched in awe.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">The nurse came over and handed me a pen and paper to fill out the birth certificate. Jackie and I had scrutinized and debated nursery colors, bottle types, strollers, day cares, his first car seat.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">But this part had never been in question for either of us.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“So, what’s his name?” the nurse asked.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">I wrote it on the paper, giving it a long look, before handing it back.</p>
		
		
		                <p class="article_p">“James,” I told her. “But we’ll call him Jay.”</p>
